I built this for fun to show case my programming skills :). The entire site is built with AngularJS 1.5 with Angular Material UI. I used Firebase for data storage . I call sightengine api from a NodeJS server running on Heroku to screen all images posted for nudity and explicit content. Leave me a comment, quote or image! Don't be shy!
